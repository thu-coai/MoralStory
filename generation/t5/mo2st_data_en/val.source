Do not attempt the impossible. # An ox came down to a reedy pool to drink. # frog puffed # great big monster # young frog # splashed heavily # huge feet
Better to yield when it is folly to resist, than to resist stubbornly and be destroyed. # A giant oak stood near a brook in which grew some slender reeds. # yielding reeds bowed low # hundred arms uplifted # reeds spoke # stand upright # great oak stood proudly upright # great hurricane rushed # mighty oak # great tree fell
In a pinch a good use of our wits may help us out. # In a spell of dry weather, # small pebbles # narrow neck # poor thing felt # water rose # thirsty crow found
Those who seek to harm others often come to harm themselves through their own deceit. # A young mouse in search of adventure was running along the bank of a pond where lived a frog. # hawk swooped # tough reed # treacherous frog # dead mouse # foolish companion # frog dangling # dare risk # good time
The evil doer often comes to harm through his own deceit. # A certain wolf could not get enough to eat because of the watchfulness of the shepherds. # sheep skin # wolf entered # wolf strolled # mutton broth # quickly led # laid hands
