It is one thing to say that something should be done, but quite a different matter to do it. # The mice once called a meeting to decide on a plan to free themselves of their enemy, # constant fear # bell ringing # young mouse # thought good # mouse arose # good fortune # dared stir
Poverty with security is better than plenty in the midst of fear and uncertainty. # A town mouse once visited a relative who lived in the country. # country mouse stopped # town mouse asked # country mouse listened # cat mew loudly # country mouse served wheat stalks # country mouse dreamed # town mouse talked # town mouse lived
It is better to yield than to come to misfortune through stubbornness. # Two goats, frisking gayly on the rocky steeps of a mountain valley, # mighty mountain torrent # roaring torrent # narrow path # met horn # bravest tremble # fallen tree formed # deep chasm
Preparedness for war is the best guarantee of peace. # A wild boar was sharpening his tusks busily against the stump of a tree, # make fun # fox happened # great show # hidden enemy
Even the weakest may find means to avenge a wrong. # A beetle once begged the eagle to spare a hare which had run to her for protection. # mountain crag # dozen feet # disrespect shown # dare harm # anger knew # great wings tumbling # cruel deed # implored great jupiter
