There are many who pretend to despise and belittle that which is beyond their reach. # A fox one day spied a beautiful bunch of ripe grapes hanging from a vine trained along the branches of a tree. # worth gaping # short distance # gazed longingly # high branch # bunch hung # running leap # mouth watered # fall short
Expect no reward for serving the wicked. # A wolf had been feasting too greedily, # awful state # stuck crosswise # crane anxiously # long neck # wolf asked # greedy wolf # wolf felt
A kindness is never wasted. # A lion lay asleep in the forest, # huge paw angrily # great ropes # quickly found # lion laid # great head resting # angry roaring # tiny creature # surely repay
We are often of greater importance in our own eyes than in the eyes of our neighbor. The smaller the mind the greater the conceit. # A gnat flew over the meadow with much buzzing for so small a creature and settled on the tip of one of the horns of a bull. # short time # made ready # resting place
Our best blessings are often the least appreciated. # Two travellers, walking in the noonday sun, # men receive # ungrateful creatures # widespreading tree # cooling shade # pleasant leaves # plane tree
